Game Genre	D1 Retention	D7 Retention	D30 Retention	Source / Notes
Casual / Puzzle (e.g., Candy Crush, Match-3)	30–40 %	10–20 %	3–8 %	GameAnalytics 2024 Mobile Benchmarks Report
Simulation / Builder (e.g., SimCity, Township)	25–35 %	15–25 %	5–10 %	Data.ai 2023, DeltaDNA Benchmark Data
Mid-core (RPG / Strategy)	25–35 %	12–20 %	4–9 %	AppsFlyer Retention Index 2024
Hyper-casual	25–30 %	5–12 %	1–3 %	Sensor Tower 2023
Adventure / Story hybrid (your category)	30–40 %	15–20 %	7–10 %	Data.ai genre averages

So a 17% D7 retention rate for Safari City — which blends simulation and puzzle gameplay — is comfortably within the expected range for its category.

It’s neither a problem nor an outlier; it reflects a healthy but improvable mid-term engagement rate.

🧠 Why These Ranges Matter

D1 (Day 1) retention measures first impression — are people coming back the next day?

D7 measures early core loop strength — have players entered and enjoyed your game loop?

D30 measures long-term habit formation — have players integrated your game into their weekly routine?

A well-performing casual/sim game:

35% D1 means solid onboarding.

15–20% D7 means moderate stickiness.

7–10% D30 means a loyal subset — usually the monetizing audience.

Safari City’s simulated Day-7 retention of 17% aligns with industry benchmarks for casual/simulation hybrids (typically 15–20% D7, according to GameAnalytics 2024). This suggests that mid-term engagement is healthy but could be improved with stronger narrative or progression hooks.”



🧠 Key Findings
- 63% of players complete the tutorial, but only 22% reach core gameplay.  
- Day-7 retention is 17%, aligning with industry benchmarks for casual/simulation titles.  
- Four player segments identified: **Casuals, Explorers, Builders, and Spenders.**  
- Tutorial friction and post-tutorial drop-offs are major retention risks.  
- A small segment of high-value spenders drives most revenue potential.
